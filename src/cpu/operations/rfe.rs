///
/// All this instruction does is shift the Interrupt Enable/User Mode bits two places back to the
/// right. This effectively undoes the opposite shift done when entering the handler and therefore
/// puts the CPU back in the mode it was when the exception triggered (unless SR itself has been
/// modified in the handler).
/// It does not reset the PC however, it's up to the BIOS to fetch the address in EPC, increment it
/// by 4 to point at the next instruction and jump to it. The RFE instruction is typically in the
/// final jump delay slot (and that's exactly what the Playstation BIOS handler does in this case).
