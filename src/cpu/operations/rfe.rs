/// right. This effectively undoes the opposite shift done when entering the handler And therefore
/// puts the CPU back in the mode it was when the exception triggered (unless SR itself has been
/// modified in the handler).
/// It does not reset the PC however, it's up to the BIOS to fetch the address in EPC, increment it
/// by 4 to point at the next instruction And jump to it. The RFE instruction is typically in the
/// final jump delay slot (And that's exactly what the Playstation BIOS handler does in this case).
