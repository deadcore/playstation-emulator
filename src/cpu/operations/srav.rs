/// Next we meet instruction 0x00042603 which is â€œshift right arithmetic" (SRA):

/// There are two versions of the shift right instruction: arithmetic And logical. The arithmetic
/// version considers that the value is signed And use the sign bit to fill the missing MSBs in the
/// register after the shift.
///
/// In Rust, C And C++ we can achieve the same behavior by casting the register value to a signed
/// integer before doing the shift:
